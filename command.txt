Remarks from Juniper 
TR-092 - Supported, the only significant requirements Juniper don’t support are ATM specific, which should not present an issue when TR-101 serves as the successor.

TR-146 - Most of the requirements are supported.

TR-300 - Most of the broadband requirements for BNG wrt PCRF or RADIUS are supported (it’s rarely requested by operator RFPs).

TR-178 - Most of the requirements are supported
